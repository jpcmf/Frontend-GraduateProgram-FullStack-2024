# Vertical Slice Architecture Migration — Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Migrate the SkateHub frontend from its current layered architecture (`components/`, `hooks/`, `services/`, `types/`) to Vertical Slice Architecture (VSA), where each feature owns its components, hooks, services, and types, with only truly shared code in `shared/`.

**Architecture:** Three top-level buckets — `app/` (Next.js routing shell, providers), `features/` (domain slices, self-contained), `shared/` (used by 2+ features: UI primitives, api client, lib utilities). Features never import from sibling features. Code is promoted to `shared/` only when two or more features need it.

**Tech Stack:** Next.js 16 App Router, React 19, TypeScript (strict), Chakra UI 2, TanStack Query v5, Zod, pnpm.

## Decisions Made Before This Plan

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| `ai-writer` feature scope | `ImproveTextButton` + `useAIWriter` + `isSupported` stay inside `features/spots/` (spots-only for now) |
| `Header`, `Sidebar`, `Footer` | Move to `shared/ui/` — layout chrome, no domain logic |

## Phase Overview

| Phase | Scope | Risk |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Move `shared/` — api, lib, config, server, hooks, theme dedup | Low |
| 2 | Merge `src/components/` → `shared/ui/` | Low |
| 3 | Co-locate hooks into features | Medium |
| 4 | Co-locate services into features | Medium |
| 5 | Co-locate types into features | Medium |
| 6 | Reorganize features internal structure + add index.ts barrels | Low |
| 7 | Update all imports across the codebase | Medium |
| 8 | Clean up empty directories | Low |

---

## Task 1: Resolve Theme Duplication

**Files:**
- Read: `src/lib/theme.ts`, `src/styles/theme.ts`, `src/styles/modal.ts`
- Create: `src/shared/lib/theme.ts`
- Create: `src/shared/lib/modal.ts`
- Delete: `src/lib/theme.ts`, `src/styles/theme.ts`, `src/styles/modal.ts`

- [ ] **Step 1: Read both theme files to identify overlaps**

```bash
cat src/lib/theme.ts
cat src/styles/theme.ts
```

Find which exports exist in both. The one in `src/styles/theme.ts` is the canonical one (used in `app/providers.tsx`).

- [ ] **Step 2: Create `src/shared/lib/theme.ts`**

Copy the content of `src/styles/theme.ts` verbatim. Add any unique exports from `src/lib/theme.ts` that are not already present.

- [ ] **Step 3: Create `src/shared/lib/modal.ts`**

Copy the content of `src/styles/modal.ts` verbatim.

- [ ] **Step 4: Update all imports pointing to the old paths**

Search and replace:
- `from "@/lib/theme"` → `from "@/shared/lib/theme"`
- `from "@/styles/theme"` → `from "@/shared/lib/theme"`
- `from "@/styles/modal"` → `from "@/shared/lib/modal"`

- [ ] **Step 5: Delete old files**

```bash
rm src/lib/theme.ts src/styles/theme.ts src/styles/modal.ts
```

- [ ] **Step 6: Verify build**

```bash
pnpm build 2>&1 | head -60
```

Expected: no errors related to theme imports.

- [ ] **Step 7: Commit**

```bash
git add -A && git commit -m "refactor: consolidate theme files into shared/lib/theme"
```

---

## Task 2: Move Shared Infrastructure (api, lib, config, server)

**Files:**
- Move: `src/lib/apiClient.ts` → `src/shared/api/apiClient.ts`
- Move: `src/lib/streamClient.ts` → `src/shared/api/streamClient.ts`
- Move: `src/lib/fonts.ts` → `src/shared/lib/fonts.ts`
- Move: `src/lib/queryClient.ts` → `src/shared/lib/queryClient.ts`
- Move: `src/lib/observability/` → `src/shared/lib/observability/`
- Move: `src/server/lib/gemini.ts` → `src/shared/server/lib/gemini.ts`
- Move: `src/server/lib/openrouter.ts` → `src/shared/server/lib/openrouter.ts`
- Merge: `src/lib/const/` + `src/utils/constant.ts` → `src/shared/config/`
- Move: `src/utils/auth.ts` → `src/shared/lib/authUtils.ts`
- Move: `src/utils/date.ts` → `src/shared/lib/date.ts`
- Move: `src/utils/mapbox.ts` → `src/shared/lib/mapbox.ts`
- Move: `src/utils/socialMedia.ts` → `src/shared/lib/socialMedia.ts`

- [ ] **Step 1: Create directory structure**

```bash
mkdir -p src/shared/api src/shared/lib/observability src/shared/lib/observability/providers src/shared/config src/shared/server/lib
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Move api client files**

```bash
mv src/lib/apiClient.ts src/shared/api/apiClient.ts
mv src/lib/streamClient.ts src/shared/api/streamClient.ts
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Move lib files**

```bash
mv src/lib/fonts.ts src/shared/lib/fonts.ts
mv src/lib/queryClient.ts src/shared/lib/queryClient.ts
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Move observability folder**

```bash
mv src/lib/observability/* src/shared/lib/observability/
mv src/lib/observability/providers/* src/shared/lib/observability/providers/
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Move server lib**

```bash
mv src/server/lib/gemini.ts src/shared/server/lib/gemini.ts
mv src/server/lib/openrouter.ts src/shared/server/lib/openrouter.ts
```

- [ ] **Step 6: Merge config constants**

Read `src/lib/const/index.ts`, `src/lib/const/categories.ts`, `src/utils/constant.ts`. Create `src/shared/config/constants.ts` that re-exports everything from all three. Move `src/lib/const/validation.ts` → `src/shared/config/validation.ts`.

- [ ] **Step 7: Move util files**

```bash
mv src/utils/auth.ts src/shared/lib/authUtils.ts
mv src/utils/date.ts src/shared/lib/date.ts
mv src/utils/mapbox.ts src/shared/lib/mapbox.ts
mv src/utils/socialMedia.ts src/shared/lib/socialMedia.ts
```

- [ ] **Step 8: Update all imports**

Run a global search-replace for each old path:

| Old | New |
|---|---|
| `@/lib/apiClient` | `@/shared/api/apiClient` |
| `@/lib/streamClient` | `@/shared/api/streamClient` |
| `@/lib/fonts` | `@/shared/lib/fonts` |
| `@/lib/queryClient` | `@/shared/lib/queryClient` |
| `@/lib/observability` | `@/shared/lib/observability` |
| `@/server/lib/gemini` | `@/shared/server/lib/gemini` |
| `@/server/lib/openrouter` | `@/shared/server/lib/openrouter` |
| `@/lib/const` | `@/shared/config/constants` |
| `@/utils/constant` | `@/shared/config/constants` |
| `@/lib/const/spotValidation` | `@/features/spots/constants` (handled in Task 5) |
| `@/lib/const/validation` | `@/shared/config/validation` |
| `@/utils/auth` | `@/shared/lib/authUtils` |
| `@/utils/date` | `@/shared/lib/date` |
| `@/utils/mapbox` | `@/shared/lib/mapbox` |
| `@/utils/socialMedia` | `@/shared/lib/socialMedia` |

- [ ] **Step 9: Verify build**

```bash
pnpm build 2>&1 | head -60
```

Expected: no import errors for moved files.

- [ ] **Step 10: Commit**

```bash
git add -A && git commit -m "refactor: move shared infrastructure to shared/api, shared/lib, shared/config"
```

---

## Task 3: Merge Components into `shared/ui/`

**Files:**
- Source: `src/components/` (all subdirs) + `src/shared/components/Form/` + `src/shared/components/Layout/`
- Destination: `src/shared/ui/`
- Resolve duplicate: `src/components/Form/Input.tsx` vs `src/shared/components/Form/Input.tsx`

- [ ] **Step 1: Create `src/shared/ui/` subdirectory**

```bash
mkdir -p src/shared/ui/form src/shared/ui/layout src/shared/ui/Header src/shared/ui/Sidebar
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Compare the two `Form/Input.tsx` files**

```bash
diff src/components/Form/Input.tsx src/shared/components/Form/Input.tsx
```

Keep the more complete version. If they differ, merge manually into `src/shared/ui/form/Input.tsx`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Move form components**

```bash
cp src/shared/components/Form/Select.tsx src/shared/ui/form/Select.tsx
cp src/shared/components/Form/Textarea.tsx src/shared/ui/form/Textarea.tsx
# Input.tsx handled manually in Step 2
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Move layout**

```bash
cp src/shared/components/Layout/index.tsx src/shared/ui/layout/index.tsx
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Move flat components from `src/components/`**

```bash
cp src/components/ActiveLink/index.tsx src/shared/ui/ActiveLink.tsx
cp src/components/CardUser/index.tsx src/shared/ui/CardUser.tsx
cp src/components/ErrorBoundary/index.tsx src/shared/ui/ErrorBoundary.tsx
cp src/components/Footer/index.tsx src/shared/ui/Footer.tsx
cp src/components/HeaderProfile/index.tsx src/shared/ui/HeaderProfile.tsx
cp src/components/LogoSkateHub/index.tsx src/shared/ui/LogoSkateHub.tsx
cp src/components/Map/MapBox.tsx src/shared/ui/MapBox.tsx
cp src/components/Pagination/index.tsx src/shared/ui/Pagination.tsx
cp src/components/ReusableModal/index.tsx src/shared/ui/ReusableModal.tsx
cp src/components/TitleSection/index.tsx src/shared/ui/TitleSection.tsx
cp src/components/Toast/index.tsx src/shared/ui/Toast.tsx
```

- [ ] **Step 6: Move Header and Sidebar (multi-file)**

```bash
cp src/components/Header/index.tsx src/shared/ui/Header/index.tsx
cp src/components/Header/Notification.tsx src/shared/ui/Header/Notification.tsx
cp src/components/Header/Profile.tsx src/shared/ui/Header/Profile.tsx
cp src/components/Header/Search.tsx src/shared/ui/Header/Search.tsx
cp src/components/Sidebar/index.tsx src/shared/ui/Sidebar/index.tsx
cp src/components/Sidebar/NavLink.tsx src/shared/ui/Sidebar/NavLink.tsx
cp src/components/Sidebar/NavSection.tsx src/shared/ui/Sidebar/NavSection.tsx
cp src/components/Sidebar/SidebarNav.tsx src/shared/ui/Sidebar/SidebarNav.tsx
```

- [ ] **Step 7: Move `QueryProvider` to `app/providers.tsx` area**

`src/components/QueryProvider/index.tsx` is a provider, not a UI component. Read it and inline its content into `src/app/providers.tsx` if not already there, or move it to `src/app/QueryProvider.tsx`.

- [ ] **Step 8: Update all imports**

| Old | New |
|---|---|
| `@/components/ActiveLink` | `@/shared/ui/ActiveLink` |
| `@/components/CardUser` | `@/shared/ui/CardUser` |
| `@/components/ErrorBoundary` | `@/shared/ui/ErrorBoundary` |
| `@/components/Footer` | `@/shared/ui/Footer` |
| `@/components/Header` | `@/shared/ui/Header` |
| `@/components/HeaderProfile` | `@/shared/ui/HeaderProfile` |
| `@/components/LogoSkateHub` | `@/shared/ui/LogoSkateHub` |
| `@/components/Map/MapBox` | `@/shared/ui/MapBox` |
| `@/components/Pagination` | `@/shared/ui/Pagination` |
| `@/components/QueryProvider` | `@/app/QueryProvider` (or inline) |
| `@/components/ReusableModal` | `@/shared/ui/ReusableModal` |
| `@/components/Sidebar` | `@/shared/ui/Sidebar` |
| `@/components/StoriesSwiper` | `@/features/stories/components/StoriesSwiper` (move in Task 6) |
| `@/components/TitleSection` | `@/shared/ui/TitleSection` |
| `@/components/Toast` | `@/shared/ui/Toast` |
| `@/components/Form/Input` | `@/shared/ui/form/Input` |
| `@/shared/components/Form/Input` | `@/shared/ui/form/Input` |
| `@/shared/components/Form/Select` | `@/shared/ui/form/Select` |
| `@/shared/components/Form/Textarea` | `@/shared/ui/form/Textarea` |
| `@/shared/components/Layout` | `@/shared/ui/layout` |

> Note: `StoriesSwiper` is in `src/components/` but is domain-specific (stories). It will be moved to `features/stories/components/` in Task 6.

- [ ] **Step 9: Verify build**

```bash
pnpm build 2>&1 | head -60
```

- [ ] **Step 10: Commit**

```bash
git add -A && git commit -m "refactor: merge components into shared/ui"
```

## Task 4: Move Shared Hooks

**Files:**
- Move: `src/hooks/useColors.ts` → `src/shared/hooks/useColors.ts`
- Move: `src/hooks/usePagination.ts` → `src/shared/hooks/usePagination.ts`

These two are used across multiple features and carry no domain logic.

- [ ] **Step 1: Create directory and move files**

```bash
mkdir -p src/shared/hooks
mv src/hooks/useColors.ts src/shared/hooks/useColors.ts
mv src/hooks/usePagination.ts src/shared/hooks/usePagination.ts
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Update imports**

| Old | New |
|---|---|
| `@/hooks/useColors` | `@/shared/hooks/useColors` |
| `@/hooks/usePagination` | `@/shared/hooks/usePagination` |

- [ ] **Step 3: Verify build**

```bash
pnpm build 2>&1 | head -60
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit**

```bash
git add -A && git commit -m "refactor: move shared hooks (useColors, usePagination) to shared/hooks"
```

## Task 5: Co-locate Spots Feature (hooks, services, types, utils, constants)

**Files:**
- Create: `src/features/spots/hooks/` (6 hooks)
- Create: `src/features/spots/services/` (5 services)
- Create: `src/features/spots/utils/isSupported.ts`
- Create: `src/features/spots/types.ts`
- Create: `src/features/spots/constants.ts`
- Create: `src/features/spots/index.ts`

- [ ] **Step 1: Create subdirectories**

```bash
mkdir -p src/features/spots/hooks src/features/spots/services src/features/spots/utils
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Move hooks**

```bash
mv src/hooks/useAIWriter.ts src/features/spots/hooks/useAIWriter.ts
mv src/hooks/useCreateSpot.ts src/features/spots/hooks/useCreateSpot.ts
mv src/hooks/useDeleteSpot.ts src/features/spots/hooks/useDeleteSpot.ts
mv src/hooks/useSpot.ts src/features/spots/hooks/useSpot.ts
mv src/hooks/useSpots.ts src/features/spots/hooks/useSpots.ts
mv src/hooks/useUpdateSpot.ts src/features/spots/hooks/useUpdateSpot.ts
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Move services**

```bash
mv src/services/createSpot.ts src/features/spots/services/createSpot.ts
mv src/services/deleteSpot.ts src/features/spots/services/deleteSpot.ts
mv src/services/getSpotById.ts src/features/spots/services/getSpotById.ts
mv src/services/getSpots.ts src/features/spots/services/getSpots.ts
mv src/services/updateSpot.ts src/features/spots/services/updateSpot.ts
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Move types**

```bash
mv src/types/spots.ts src/features/spots/types.ts
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Move AI writer utils**

```bash
mv src/utils/ai/isSupported.ts src/features/spots/utils/isSupported.ts
```

- [ ] **Step 6: Create spots constants**

Read `src/lib/const/spotValidation.ts` and create `src/features/spots/constants.ts` with its content. This file stays in spots — it is spot-specific.

- [ ] **Step 7: Move `ImproveTextButton` into spots components**

```bash
mv src/shared/components/ImproveTextButton.tsx src/features/spots/components/ImproveTextButton.tsx
```

Update the import inside `src/features/spots/SpotForm/index.tsx` (or its new location after Task 6).

- [ ] **Step 8: Create `src/features/spots/index.ts` barrel**

```typescript
// src/features/spots/index.ts
export { default as SpotCard } from "./SpotCard/index";
export { default as SpotDetail } from "./SpotDetail/index";
export { default as SpotForm } from "./SpotForm/index";
```

Adjust paths after Task 6 flattens the subdirectories if needed.

- [ ] **Step 9: Update all imports**

| Old | New |
|---|---|
| `@/hooks/useAIWriter` | `@/features/spots/hooks/useAIWriter` |
| `@/hooks/useCreateSpot` | `@/features/spots/hooks/useCreateSpot` |

| `@/services/getSpotById` | `@/features/spots/services/getSpotById` |
| `@/services/getSpots` | `@/features/spots/services/getSpots` |
| `@/services/updateSpot` | `@/features/spots/services/updateSpot` |
| `@/types/spots` | `@/features/spots/types` |
| `@/utils/ai/isSupported` | `@/features/spots/utils/isSupported` |
| `@/lib/const/spotValidation` | `@/features/spots/constants` |
| `@/shared/components/ImproveTextButton` | `@/features/spots/components/ImproveTextButton` |

- [ ] **Step 10: Verify build**

```bash
pnpm build 2>&1 | head -60
```

- [ ] **Step 11: Commit**

```bash
git add -A && git commit -m "refactor: co-locate spots hooks, services, types, utils into features/spots"
```

## Task 10: Clean Up Empty Directories and Verify Final State

- [ ] **Step 1: Remove now-empty directories**

```bash
rmdir src/hooks 2>/dev/null || echo "hooks not empty — check remaining files"
rmdir src/services 2>/dev/null || echo "services not empty — check remaining files"
rmdir src/types 2>/dev/null || echo "types not empty — check remaining files"
rmdir src/utils/ai 2>/dev/null
rmdir src/utils 2>/dev/null || echo "utils not empty — check remaining files"
rmdir src/lib/const 2>/dev/null
rmdir src/lib/observability/providers 2>/dev/null
rmdir src/lib/observability 2>/dev/null
rmdir src/lib 2>/dev/null || echo "lib not empty — check remaining files"
rmdir src/contexts 2>/dev/null
rmdir src/server/lib 2>/dev/null
rmdir src/server 2>/dev/null
rmdir src/styles 2>/dev/null
rmdir src/components/AvatarEditProfile 2>/dev/null  # was already empty
rmdir src/components/StoriesSwiper 2>/dev/null
rmdir src/components 2>/dev/null || echo "components not empty — check remaining files"
rmdir src/shared/components/Form 2>/dev/null
rmdir src/shared/components/Layout 2>/dev/null
rmdir src/shared/components 2>/dev/null
rm -rf src/features/login  # folder now empty after auth migration
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Confirm no orphaned imports**

```bash
pnpm build 2>&1 | grep -E "error|Cannot find|Module not found"
```

Expected: no errors.

- [ ] **Step 3: Confirm no cross-feature imports**

```bash
# Check that no feature imports from a sibling feature
grep -r "from \"@/features/" src/features/ | grep -v "from \"@/features/$(dirname $0)" | head -20
```

Manual review: any result here is a cross-feature import violation and needs to be resolved by promoting the shared piece to `shared/`.

- [ ] **Step 4: Final build**

```bash
pnpm build
```

Expected: clean build, no TypeScript errors.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add -A && git commit -m "refactor: remove empty directories after VSA migration"
```

## Task 11: Update Documentation

**Files:**
- Modify: `docs/TECHNICAL_ANALYSIS.md` — add Section 14 on VSA architecture decision
- Modify: `AGENTS.md` — update architecture conventions to reflect new paths

- [ ] **Step 1: Add Section 14 to `docs/TECHNICAL_ANALYSIS.md`**

Append at end of file:

```markdown
## 14. Architecture Migration — Vertical Slice Architecture (May 2026)

### Decision

Migrated from a layered architecture (`components/`, `hooks/`, `services/`, `types/`) to
**Vertical Slice Architecture (VSA)**.

### Rationale

FSD (Feature-Sliced Design) was evaluated but rejected as overly complex for this project's
scale (single developer, ~7 feature domains). VSA provides the same feature cohesion guarantees
with far less ceremony: 3 layers instead of 7, no mandatory taxonomy, no linter enforcement needed.

### Rule

> A file belongs in `features/<domain>/` if only one feature uses it.
> A file belongs in `shared/` when two or more features use it.
> Features must never import from sibling features.

### New Structure

| Old Path | New Path |
|---|---|
| `src/components/` | `src/shared/ui/` |
| `src/hooks/use<Domain>*` | `src/features/<domain>/hooks/` |
| `src/services/<verb><Entity>` | `src/features/<domain>/services/` |
| `src/types/<domain>.ts` | `src/features/<domain>/types.ts` |
| `src/lib/apiClient` | `src/shared/api/apiClient` |
| `src/lib/queryClient` | `src/shared/lib/queryClient` |
| `src/lib/observability/` | `src/shared/lib/observability/` |
| `src/utils/` | `src/shared/lib/` |
| `src/server/lib/` | `src/shared/server/lib/` |
| `src/contexts/AuthContext` | `src/features/auth/context/AuthContext` |
| `src/styles/` | `src/shared/lib/` |
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Update `AGENTS.md` architecture conventions section**

Update the "Architecture Conventions" bullet list to replace old paths with new VSA paths. Key changes:

- `src/components/` → `src/shared/ui/`
- `src/hooks/use<Entity>.ts` → `src/features/<domain>/hooks/use<Entity>.ts`
- `src/services/<verb><Entity>.ts` → `src/features/<domain>/services/<verb><Entity>.ts`
- `src/types/<feature>.ts` → `src/features/<domain>/types.ts`
- `src/lib/apiClient.ts` → `src/shared/api/apiClient.ts`

- [ ] **Step 3: Commit docs**

```bash
git add docs/TECHNICAL_ANALYSIS.md AGENTS.md
git commit -m "docs: document VSA migration decision and update architecture conventions"
```
