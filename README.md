## SkateHub Frontend powered by Next.js

The project requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and [Backend-GraduateProgram-FullStack-2023](https://github.com/jpcmf/Backend-GraduateProgram-FullStack-2023) to run locally.

## :gear: Build setup

Welcome! Here's a quick guide to getting started with `SkateHub Frontend`. Let's dive in:

### ðŸ‘£ Step 1: Clone the repository

First things first, let's clone the repository onto your local machine. If you're not sure how to do this, no worries! Here's a simple command you can run in your terminal:

```bash
# clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/jpcmf/Frontend-GraduateProgram-FullStack-2024.git
```

### ðŸ‘£ Step 2: Navigate to the project directory

Once the repository is cloned, navigate into the project directory using the cd command in your terminal:

```bash
# navigate to the project directory

cd Frontend-GraduateProgram-FullStack-2024
```

### ðŸ‘£ Step 3: Switch to the develop branch

Our development work usually happens in the develop branch. Make sure you're on the right branch by executing the following command:

```bash
# switch to the develop branch

git checkout develop
```

### ðŸ‘£ Step 4: Configure environment variables

Before running the project, you'll need to configure the environment variables. This typically involves setting up database credentials and other configurations. Locate the `.env.example` file in the project root directory, and create a new file named `.env` with your configurations. You may need to consult the project documentation for the required variables.

```bash
# configure environment variables

cp .env.example .env.local
```

### ðŸ‘£ Step 5: Install dependencies

Now that you're in the project directory and on the correct branch, it's time to install all the dependencies. Simply run:

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install
```

### ðŸ‘£ Step 6: Run the project

You're almost there! To start the application in development mode, just type the following command:

```bash
# run at localhost:3000
npm run dev
```

And that's it! Your `SkateHub Frontend` should now be up and running locally on your [machine](http://localhost:3000).
